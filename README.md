This is the first example from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Udemy course:

**Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide (incl. Vue Router & Vuex)**

It's a great example of how to use Vue to render to the DOM. We learned how to access data and use data-binding. Also it utilizes conditionals and for-loops.

This course is a great reminder of the Vue frontend framework.
